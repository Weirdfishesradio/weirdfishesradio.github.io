<h1>about gnawed</h1>



<p>

gnawed is a one-person brand created and run by a high school student.

every piece is altered and reconstructed by hand.

</p>



<p>

this project began as a way to transform forgotten clothing into something

intentional and quietly beautiful.

</p>



<p>

a portion of profits are donated to

<a href="https://onetreeplanted.org" target="_blank">

One Tree Planted

</a>,

supporting global reforestation efforts.

</p>



<p>

nothing here is mass produced.

everything is made slowly.
